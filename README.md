# British TV and radio logos for MediaPortal 1

## Introduction

This repository contains British cable (Virgin Media), satellite (Freesat and Sky), terrestrial (Freeview) and Irish satellite (Sky) television channel and radio station logos for use with [MediaPortal 1](https://www.team-mediaportal.com/) and the [LogoManager plugin](https://www.team-mediaportal.com/extensions/utilities/logomanager). Source folders contain high quality SVG and PNG logos with dark and light designs. Any help would be very much appreciated, I can be contacted either through the MediaPortal forums or GitHub issues.
